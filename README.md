# Instagram Reel Downloader API

This is a FastAPI-based backend application that allows you to download Instagram reel videos by providing the reel URL. The API extracts the video URL from the Instagram reel and returns it in JSON format.

## Features

- **Extract Video URL**: Given an Instagram reel URL, the API extracts the direct video URL.
- **CORS Enabled**: The API is configured to allow requests from any origin, making it easy to integrate with frontend applications.
- **Deployable on Vercel**: The project is configured for easy deployment on Vercel.
